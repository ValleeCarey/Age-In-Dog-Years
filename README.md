# Age-In-Dog-Years

For this project to be able to calculate human age in dog years, I first defined my age then the age of the dog.

The first two years of a dog life is equivalent to 21 years and increases 4 years every other year.

Therefore, i subtracted two years from my age because I already accounted for the two years of dog years.

Then, i multiplied my age minus two times four to get my age in dog years.

Finally, I use string interpolation to log to the console my age in dog years in a complete sentence.
